# Simple React Home Site

This is the source for my personal home page (andrewlienhard.com), so it's more of a way to keep my code safe than be a useful open source project. It runs on react and redux backed by the bootstrap theme, Freelance.

# npm start 
will kick off react-scripts and will try to grab port 3000. Make sure that's available on your config.

# About the XWord

I've been keeping a list of words that stumped me while working the NYT crossword puzzle. I decided to put it to use.

# About the Photos

I'm using the Flickr API to fetch my photostream. The Gallery is based on one from Joel at egghead, but with my own features added.
